1.  Introduction

   The purpose of this document is to motivate the design of ICN
   manifests and illustrate several use cases in which they might be
   used.  It is not intended to specify a standard design, nor is it
   meant to evaluate existing designs.  The goal is simply to present a
   set of (non-exhaustive) requirements that the ICN community can use
   when evaluating different manifest proposals.

2.  A Minimalist Picture

   A manifest is a index used to encode a large and possibly infinite
   stream of data.  In most cases, this stream is static and finite,
   meaning that the manifest simply encodes a large Content Object.
   Logically, a manifest may be perceived as a collection of pointers to
   other Content Objects and some additional metadata (TBD), as shown
   below.

   +---------------+
   | TYPE=MANIFEST |
   |---------------|
   |   metadata    |
   |---------------|
   |   Pointer 1   | ==> +--------------+
   |               |     | TYPE=CONTENT |
   |               |     |   <payload>  |
   |               |     +--------------+
   |   Pointer 2   | ==> +--------------+
   |               |     | TYPE=CONTENT |
   |               |     |   <payload>  |
   |               |     +--------------+
   |   Pointer 3   | ==> +---------------+
   +---------------+     | TYPE=MANIFEST |
                         |---------------|
                         |   Pointer 1   | ==> +--------------+
                         +---------------+     | TYPE=CONTENT |
                                               |   <payload>  |
                                               +--------------+

   Details about the type and encoding of metadata, the role and usage
   of Content Object pointers, and the types of data that can be
   represented by a Manifest are an ongoing design challenges.

3.  Possible Use Cases

   In this section we enumerate possible use cases that can be addressed
   by Manifests.  This list is not exhaustive, and is open to
   modification and extension from the community.

   o  UseCase-1: Store only Content Object metadata (data embedding)

   o  UseCase-2: Store direct links to Content Object (chunks).

   o  UseCase-3: Store indirect links to Content Object (chunks), e.g.,
      other manifests.

   o  UseCase-5: Encode open-ended data streams (i.e., manifests may
      point to data not yet in existence)

   o  UseCase-6: Support named and nameless Content Objects.

   o  UseCase-7: Efficiently encode sparse Content Object files, with
      possible compression.

   o  UseCase-8: Encapsulate (and indicate the presence of) encrypted
      data.

   o  UseCase-9: Encode read-access information (e.g., decryption keys
      or metadata about how to get these keys).

   o  UseCase-10: Provide alternate sources for a Content Object data
      blocks (i.e., give more than one routing hint).

   o  UseCase-11: Serve as thunks in Named Function Networking.  See
      also UseCase-22 (database cursor), "next record" pointing to
      results not yet computed.

   o  UseCase-12: Describe the namespace of a particular Content Object.

   o  UseCase-13: Store authenticated denial namespace descriptions (see
      above).

   o  UseCase-14: Encode different traversal strategies for visiting
      Content Object pointers contained in a Manifest.

   o  UseCase-15: Encode parallel forks (file resource forks or property
      lists associated with a Content Object).

   o  UseCase-16: Support Content Object personalization and
      internationalization.

   o  UseCase-17: Group related data together (e.g., for Web page
      content).

   o  UseCase-18: Provide transport-layer information.

   o  UseCase-19: Facilitate Content Object, service, or entity
      discovery.

   o  UseCase-20: Enable content deletion in routers/forwarders.

   o  UseCase-21: Embed authentication key information (e.g., key
      catalogs).

   o  UseCase-22: Serve as database cursor i.e., for returning partial
      results that contain pointers to the previous and next records,
      for example.

   o  UseCase-23: Turn the manifest data structure into a block chain
      (tamperproof open list of records)

   o  UseCase-24: (decentralized) trusted timestamping

   o  USeCAse-25: backend storage for a control versioning system,
      GitHub style

4.  Security Considerations

   TODO.

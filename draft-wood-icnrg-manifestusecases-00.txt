1.  Introduction

   The purpose of this document is to motivate the design of advanced
   ICN Manifests and illustrate several network and application use
   cases in which they might be used.  These manifests may be built on
   top of the base FLIC manifest [FLIC].  This document is not intended
   to specify a standard design.

2.  Use Cases

   In this section we enumerate possible use cases that could be
   addressed by advanced Manifests.  This list is not exhaustive, and is
   open to modification and extension from the community.

1.  Introduction

   The purpose of this document is to motivate the design of advanced
   ICN Manifests and illustrate several network and application use
   cases in which they might be used.  These manifests may be built on
   top of the base FLIC manifest [FLIC].  This document is not intended
   to specify a standard design.

2.  Use Case Descriptions

   In this section we enumerate possible use cases that could be
   addressed by advanced Manifests.  This list is not exhaustive, and is
   open to modification and extension from the community.

   1.  Amortize verification cost of chunks

   2.  Support network-layer prefetching

   3.  Store Content Object metadata

   Metadata that is common to multiple content objects can be offloaded
   to a parent manifest.  Alternatively, the manifest can carry only
   metadata instead of pointers to actual data.  Examples of metadata
   include:

   o  Offload metadata in content objects to parent manifest

   o  Authenticated denial information

   o  Service or entity discovery information

   o  Embedded authentication key information (e.g., key catalogs)

   o  The namespace of a Content Object (e.g., names of related content)

   1.  Group related data together

   A manifest can combine data from multiple sources into one combined
   object.  One such example would be a webpage, containing images from

   an image repository, text from another one, cookies and tracking
   objects from a third party and advertisement from another provider
   for such content.  The overall name in the manifest would be that of
   the webpage, say www.cnn.com/frontpage but the manifest would group
   all the data together.

   The grouping of object together may guide caching policies at the
   network level, if caching is allowable.  For instance, the objects
   associated into a common group could be cached under the same rule.

   1.  Encode different content locator strategies

   A possible use case is to prioritize potential locators and therefore
   to embed a content locator strategy into the manifest.  If multiple
   copies of the content corresponding to the manifest exist, the
   manifest could present a selection strategy.  Say, try this copy
   first, then this one, then this one, etc.  Other strategies are
   possible, say selecting chunks from different locations, etc.

   The strategy may refer to different network locations, therefore
   offering different network paths to the objects.  The different
   network paths have of course implication on the application layer as
   well.

   1.  Encode different traversal strategies for visiting Content Object
       pointers contained in a Manifest

   Different Content Object may have different purpose within an
   application, some being critical and some being less sensitive.  For
   instance, I-frames in an MPEG GOP may be visited first, then P-frames
   and B-frames may be visited next, depending upon the network
   conditions.  Similarly, in a scalable video encoding, the base layer
   may be visited first by the traversal strategy, then the enhancement
   layers.

   The manifest should be able to encode this traversal strategy to help
   both the application function properly under the current network
   conditions, and potentially, as in the case of rate adaptation for
   scalable video streaming, to help the network deal with congestion
   events.

   1.  Support Content Object personalization and internationalization

   This use case for the manifest enables contextualization of the
   content, by grouping different objects together depending on the
   location of the user, the copy of the manifest, or on some other
   information.  For instance, a manifest under a given name stored in a
   data center in one country may group together picture objects with

   caption objects in the language of this country; while it would
   include caption objects in another language in a different country.

   1.  Encode open-ended data streams

   The manifest could be used as a pointer for data that does not exist
   yet.  It could then optionally include information as to when this
   data will become available for request.

   1.  Diff-encoded content versioning

   The manifest can only include the diff of a content object from one
   version to another.  A consumer can fetch previous versions of a
   manifest to construct the latest version of the manifest.

3.  Use Case Classification

   The following table indicates which use cases are applicable to the
   network and application layers in the ICN stack.

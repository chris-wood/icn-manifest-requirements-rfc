1.  Introduction

   The purpose of this document is to motivate the design of ICN
   Manifests and illustrate several use cases in which they might be
   used.  It is not intended to specify a standard design, nor is it
   meant to evaluate existing designs.  The goal is simply to present a
   set of (non-exhaustive) cases where ICN Manifests may prove useful
   for the "network" and "application" layer.

2.  A Minimalist Picture

   A manifest is a index used to represent some stream of data.  In most
   cases, this stream is static and finite, meaning that the manifest
   simply represents a piece of existing application data.  Static CCNx
   Manifests, for example, are a particular type of Manifest that seek
   to achieve this goal.  Logically, a manifest may be perceived as a
   collection of pointers to other Content Objects and some additional
   metadata (TBD), as shown below.

         Figure 1: A minimalist representation of an ICN manifest.

   Details about the type and encoding of metadata, the role and usage
   of Message pointers, and the types of data that can be represented by
   a Manifest are ongoing architectural and design challenges.

3.  Use Cases

   In this section we enumerate possible use cases that could be
   addressed by Manifests.  This list is not exhaustive, and is open to
   modification and extension from the community.
